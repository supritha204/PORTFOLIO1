            <p>A Library Management System is a software application designed to
                 handle various library operations efficiently, such as cataloging, 
                 borrowing and returning books, 
                managing member records, and generating reports</p>
                <p>Project Overview:</p>
                <li>Language: Java</li>
                <li>Database Management System: MySQL, Oracle, or any other DBMS</li>
                <li>User Interface: Swing or JavaFX for creating the graphical user interface (GUI)</li>

            <p>Number Plate Recognition (NPR) is a computer vision-based technology in which we capture the image of vehicle. 
                After capturing the image of the vehicle we extract the number plate of a vehicle to identify the details of the owner of the vehicle.
                After this we pass the detected plate to the Optical Character 
                Recognition system where it will detect the character from the video 
                and provide the number plate of the vehicle as a string to the Database and  
                image of number plate.
